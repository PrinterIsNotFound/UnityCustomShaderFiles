# UnityCustomShaderFiles
this contains the files for my custom shader in unity



how to set up the shader in unity:

Step 1.
drag the "customCameraShader.shader" into the project folder and create a new material using the shader.


Step 2.
Drag the "putThisOnTheCamera.cs" into the project folder and attach the script to the camera in your scene.


Step 3.
drag the material you created into the material field in the script.


Step 4.
adjust the lighting in the scene and the material parameters to fine-tune the look you are going for.


Step 5.
I suggest using low resolution textures with normal maps if you want to recreate the look from my game.
